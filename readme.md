**Employee Promotion Prediction 📊🤖**

This project builds a machine learning solution to predict whether an employee is likely to get promoted based on historical employee data. The project covers data loading, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and model building using Python.

**Project Structure**

employee.ipynb – Jupyter Notebook containing the complete analysis and model

train.csv – Dataset used for training

README.md – Project documentation

**Technologies Used**

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook

VS Code

**Dataset Description**

The dataset includes employee-related attributes such as education, department, gender, recruitment channel, number of trainings, previous year rating, length of service, awards won, average training score, and promotion status (target variable).

Steps Performed

Imported required Python libraries

Loaded the dataset using Pandas

Handled Windows file path issues

Removed unnecessary columns (e.g., employee_id)

Cleaned and preprocessed the data

Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Built and evaluated machine learning models

How to Run the Project

Open the project folder in VS Code

Install required libraries:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn


Open employee.ipynb and run the cells sequentially

**Key Learnings**

Proper handling of CSV file paths in Windows

Data preprocessing using Pandas

Feature selection and preparation for ML models

Understanding Git warnings related to line endings (LF vs CRLF)

Building a basic end-to-end machine learning workflow

Notes

This project is created for learning and practice purposes

The dataset is used strictly for educational analysis
